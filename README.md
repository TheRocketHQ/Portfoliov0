> My biggest concern since the very start was in keeping a track of what I've learn, after all, we're all humans here (.. at least for now); 
> The Initial Ideia an was to bundle all my projects in one repo to work has a Plan tracker on what i've been up to
> The notes will be in commits, I won't waste time going on for readme's like I once did in the past..
>Enjoy reading my commits.
