> It's been a while..
>
> Throughout my whole career and learning path in Programming, I've encountered bad notes, ugly notes, and good notes..
>
> Therefore my biggest concern since the very start was in keeping a track of what I've learn, after all, we're all humans here (.. at least for now); 
>So all my knowledge and everything i know today (or at least what I think I know) will start to fade, and soon my muscle memory will begin to decay, till nothing remains just like ruins of a sand castle some kid did on a summer day. 
>
> The Initial an was to bundle all my projects in one repo (my OCD was ticking, lol), then a better idea occur and this private repo became public.
> These notes will be in commits, I won't waste time going on for readme's like I once did in the past..
> So yeah, that's all folks, enjoy reading my commits.
