> It's been a while..
>
> Throughout my whole career and learning path in Programming, I've encountered bad notes, ugly notes, and good notes..
>
> Therefore my biggest concern since the very start was in keeping a track of what I've learn, after all, we're all humans here (.. at least for now); So what I know today (or at least what I think I know) with the small stop will start to fade, and soon my muscle memory will begin to decay, till nothing remains just like ruins of a sand castle some kid did on a summer day. 
> So this way all will be bundle, my notes will be in commits, I won't waste time going on for readme's like I once did in the past..
>
> The Initial an was to bundle all my projects in one repo (my OCD was ticking, lol), then a better idea occur and this private repo became public.
>
> Later on, my path will be included here, at least from now on, counting from the very beginning would be absolutely mental, and time consuming lol.
>
> So yeah, that's all folks, enjoy reading my commits.
